Abler is run by [Sara Hendren](http://sarahendren.siteleaf.net). I'm tracking and commenting on art, adaptive technologies and prosthetics, the future of human bodies in the built environment, and related ideas.

I'm an artist and design researcher. I also teach design for engineers-in-training, and I've just started the [Adaptation + Ability Group](http://adaptationabilitygroup.siteleaf.net), a research lab at Olin College. We'll be documenting our work here starting in 2015. You can see some of my own projects—making, writing, speaking—[here](http://sarahendren.siteleaf.net).
