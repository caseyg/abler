I really enjoyed meeting and talking with Christina Agapakis, who wrote about the Moveable Chair work for Scientific American's [Oscillator](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/oscillator/2011/08/23/editing-the-city/) blog.

And more on Christina's very interesting research and projects at her [web site](http://www.agapakis.com/index.html).
