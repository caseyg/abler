[![A woman wears a "necklace" of pea-sized gold beads, strung together in rows of three that meet at the sternum and then wrap around the back of the body, like a harness or piece of armor.](http://ablersite.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/exo11.jpg)](http://ablersite.org/2012/12/03/the-exo/exo11/#main)

[History + Industry](http://historyandindustry.bigcartel.com/) will have this ["exo" jewelry](http://historyandindustry.bigcartel.com/product/exo) available soon. "More body armor than necklace," this piece makes me wonder if we'll see the exoskeleton trope around more and more. [Ekso bionics](http://www.eksobionics.com/#slide2) and the [Magic Arms](http://ablersite.org/2012/08/02/magic-arms/) certainly do suggest a lot of possibilities.
