[Sascha Nordmeyer](http://www.saschanordmeyer.com/)'s prosthetic "smile simulator" tool will be part of MOMA's [Talk to Me](http://moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1080), a show that opens today. Looks greatâ€”and [there's a blog](http://wp.moma.org/talk_to_me/) where the curators have also cataloged their process of finding work to include. A whole database of interesting projects there, both under the [checked](http://wp.moma.org/talk_to_me/checked-2/) tab and in the [queue](http://wp.moma.org/talk_to_me/queue/).

_ "Talk to Me_ explores the communication between people and things. All objects contain information that goes well beyond their immediate use or appearance."

"...Whether openly and actively, or in subtle, subliminal ways, things talk to us, and designers help us develop and improvise the dialogue."
